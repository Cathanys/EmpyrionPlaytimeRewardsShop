# EmpyrionPlaytimeRewardsShop

## What is it?
With this mod, players can buy items from their playtime.
This is my first Empyrion mod combining the [Backpack Extender](https://github.com/GitHub-TC/EmpyrionBackpackExtender) and [Playtime Rewards](https://github.com/GitHub-TC/EmpyrionPlaytimeRewards) Mod for the server application and used the DemoMod for the Client application.
Thanks for all the support from the Empyrion Discord ðŸ’œ

## Installation

**Don't use it. It is under development and not finished. It will crash with 99% chance.**
For Server copy the content of the EmpyrionPlayerRewardsShop ZIP into the folder Content\Mods\
For Single Player mode copy the content of the EmpyrionPlayerRewardsShop_Client ZIP into the folder Content\Mods\

## Configuration
After starting the server or game with the mod in the correct folder, the configuration will be created here:
\[SaveGamePath\]\\Mods\\EmpyrionPlaytimeRewardsShop\\Configuration.json

For each item you want to add to the shop, add an entry in the item rewards sections.
The item ids are the "Game ID" from the database: https://empyrionbuddy.com (with the correct Scenario activated in their settings)

Currently these stats are implemented:
- "life" - increases the maximum health
- "exp" - increases the players experience points

```json
{
	"ChatCommandPrefix":"/\\prs",
	"RewardPeriodInMinutes":5,
	"RewardPointsPerPeriod":10,
	"RewardItems":
	[
		{"Name":"neo","Description":"Neodynium Ore","quantity":100,"price":100,"itemId":4300},
